## description
 I made this project to help a business take notes of tasks that need to be done.
 In doing this I solved the problem of need a space to be able to take notes of things that need to be done, tasks to be completed, and general  reminders.
 In doing this project I gained a much better understanding of how to build routes, working with servers, pulling information from a database using a get route, putting info into a db with a post route. I also learned more about how to use heroku to deply an app.

## Installation
  To install this program you will need to copy all files, run an npm install, if you want to install it locally. It  is   deployed on heroku and can be used from there as well. The link is below.

## usage
  once you have opened it on the sever or gone to the heroku site that its being hoseted on above, press the get started button and it will take you to the notes page. On the notes page you will see notes that have already been saved, you can click on them to see the details, you can also press on the trash can to delete the note. To enter a new note click where it says note title and type in the title you want the note saved under, if you have details to enter click on the note text area and type in the text you want to go with the note title. After you have entered the text click on the save button towards the top right and you will see the note saved on the left side with the other notes that are already stored. If you are viewing a note and want to add a new note press the plus sign in the top right of the screen and it will bring you back to the page where you can enter in a new note.
